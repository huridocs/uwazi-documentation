# Introduction to Uwazi

To manage records and documents, most organisations today use folders or categories on platforms like DropBox, OneDrive and Google Drive so that staff can access them later. Although safe and effective, these platforms simply provide a safe space for these documents and provide no connections or analysis.

What if organising documents could make their contents come alive? Uwazi goes beyond tags and filenames to organise your documents. Each document can be critical in telling a story: an email that asks for a favor from a politician, a testimony from a witness of police violence, the ruling of a court on a human rights case. When these stories are connected by the platform, the bigger picture of patterns and systems becomes clearer: ongoing corruption, systematic police violence, legal human rights precedence and abuse of power.

Uwazi is built to do exactly this – highlight and organise the important information in each document, and create relationships between documents. Uwazi illuminates the bigger picture that human rights document collections uncover.

## What problems does Uwazi solve?

Most document management systems organise contents based on a document’s metadata such as author, department, person, event, or year.

However, for human rights organisations, a document is often much more than these basic descriptors assigned to it . The content within the document also provides important insight.

Uwazi addresses these problems by putting content and connections at the heart of the platform. Within each document there is important information to highlight, tag, organise, reference, and connect to other documents. In Uwazi, one paragraph referencing a military commander responsible for a human rights violation can be connected to another paragraph in another document that provides more biographical information about the same person.

## Who is it for?

Uwazi was designed to address the needs of human rights organisations. Human rights NGOs, National Human Rights Institutions, Universities, Journalists, Courts, and others working with large document collections can also benefit from Uwazi’s user friendly features.
