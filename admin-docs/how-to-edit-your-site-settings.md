# How to Edit Your Site Settings

Step 1: Click on **Settings**, then click on **Collection**.

Step 2: After you have made all your changes, please ensure that you click **Save**.

## Change the name of your collection ([*screencast*](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_6ele0a2bmdSbLD1-UjUfSd53JaUL54T))

- The name is "Uwazi" by default, but you can change it to anything you like.

## Make your collection private (or public)

![image alt text](images/image_5.png)

- If you are handling sensitive information or you just want your collection to be accessible only via login, you can click the checkbox to make the instance private.

- By activating this option, your information will not be crawled by search engines, and users will be prompted with a login screen when trying to access your documents or entities.

## Change the date format

- You may change the date format, based on your preference.

## Set your landing page

![image alt text](images/image_6.png)

- The landing page is the first thing users will see when visiting your Uwazi instance.

- By default, the landing page is set to the full Library![image alt text](images/image_7.png)without any filters applied.

- But you can use any page from your Uwazi instance as the landing page instead. Copy and paste the URL on the text box, accordingly. These are some examples:
  
  - A static page: /page/dicxg0oagy3xgr7ixef80k9
  
  - A library query: /library/?searchTerm=test
  
  - A document or entity: /document/4y9i99fadjp833di /entity/9htbkgpkyy7j5rk9
  
  - Always use a URL relative to your site, starting with / and skipping the [https://yoursite.com](https://yoursite.com).

## Track web analytics

  - If you are hosting your Uwazi with HURIDOCS, we provide Matomo as part of the hosting. Please contact us to activate your account.

## Mailer configuration

![image alt text](images/image_10.png)

This allows you to configure your own SMTP or any other mail server. Instances hosted by HURIDOCS have the mail system already configured.

- This is a JSON configuration object that should match the options values required by Nodemailer, as explained [here](http://nodemailer.com/smtp/).

- This setting takes precedence over all other mailer configuration. If left blank, then the configuration file in /api/config/mailer.js will be used.

## Contact form configuration

If you have added a contact form on one of your pages, this is where you would add the email address that receives the information from that form. Click [here](#heading=h.2foqgdkokzfp) to learn how to add and configure a contact form on a webpage.

## Public form configuration

If you have added a public intake or submission form on one of your pages, this is where you would add the template ID (representing the numbers in the template URL). You must white-list the template IDs for which public forms are expected. Please include a comma-separated list of template IDs without spaces.
