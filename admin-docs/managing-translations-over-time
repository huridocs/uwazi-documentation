# Managing translations over time

Creating a new entity
When you create a new entity, all of its metadata properties are synced to all languages when the entity is first saved.

Editing an existing entity

When you edit an existing entity, changes to the following metadata properties will get synced to all languages:
-   Thesaurus-based properties (select and multiselect fields)
-   Relationships
-   Date-based properties
-   Geolocation
-   Numeric properties
-   The Table of Contents if the same source document is used in other languages (since it depends on the contents of the document)

Changes to the following metadata properties will NOT be synced, so you will need to make any necessary updates in other languages manually:
-   Text references
-   Media
-   Text and Rich Text fields
