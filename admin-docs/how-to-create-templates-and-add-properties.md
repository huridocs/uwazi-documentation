# How to create templates and add properties

Templates are the foundation of your Uwazi platform as they allow you to attribute consistent, structured metadata to your entities. Within each template, you can assign a variety of properties like:

- Text

- Numerics

- Select (needs thesaurus)

- Multi-select (needs thesaurus)

- Date, date range, multi date, multi date range

- Rich text

- Geolocation

- External links

- Media (for video and audio embedding or self hosting)

- Relationship - allow you to create connections between this entity and another one

## Add different properties to a template

Properties provide an important way for users to view important metadata at a glance and filter the collection to better understand and analyse the collection.

Step 1: From **Settings**, click on **Templates**.

Step 2: Click on the green **Add Template** button.

- There will be two default properties: Title and Date Added.

Step 3: Name your template and select a color for it.

Step 4: On the right side panel, there is a list of **Properties**. Each property will provide the user with more information about your entity. You can add as few or as many as you wish. Drag and drop one property at a time onto the template.

Step 5: For each added property, click **Edit** and give it a name (Label). Review the other options for the property, which may include the following:

- **Select list** - for Select and Multi Select properties, choose which Thesaurus will be used for this property. Related to: [How to create thesauri](https://uwazi.readthedocs.io/en/initial-setup/admin-docs/how-to-create-thesauri.html).
- **Hide label** will show this property without the label/name.
- **Required property** will prevent the entity from being saved if this property isn't filled in.
- **Show in cards** means this property will appear in the Uwazi library cards as part of the basic info.
  - Note that the Uwazi library cards will also show the user's _current sorting criterion_ even if that property is not configured with "Show in cards." For example, this happens frequently with the "Date added" property, which is the default sorting criterion in the library. When the cards are sorted by "Date added," the "Date added" property is visible in the cards to show the user why the cards are in the current order.
- **Use as filter** means this property will be able to be used to filter the library view.
- **Default filter** means this property will be used as a default filter in the library view.
- **Priority sorting** means this property will be used as default sorting criterion.
- **Full width** will show this property using the full width available (applies to Media, Image, and Preview properties).

Step 6: Remember to click on **Save** after you have created properties for each template.

> If you intend to do a CSV import to bring your metadata into Uwazi in bulk, remember that the property names on these templates must match your field names in the CSV file. This will allow the data migration to be imported successfully with all the metadata in the correct template. Related to: [How to migrate data with csv import](https://uwazi.readthedocs.io/en/initial-setup/admin-docs/how-to-upload-and-publish-documents.html#import-your-documents-through-csv-import-data-migration).
> 
> **Warning:** Uwazi does not support the use of non-Latin characters (such as Arabic text or accented characters) on template configuration. This includes template titles and property names. In order to use non-Latin characters in template titles or property names, you must first create them in Latin characters, and then translate those phrases under the "Translations" tab in Settings as described in [How to translate your content](https://uwazi.readthedocs.io/en/initial-setup/admin-docs/how-to-translate-your-content.html). If this is not done, it will trigger a known bug. Our developers are working to fix it.
