# How to Configure Main and Secondary Filters

Filter options will depend on the metadata properties you have included on each entity in your collection. In Uwazi, you can choose which fields that you want to show as filters.

While configuring the filters in your instance, remember this can help users find information or direct them to specific analysis within the collection.

## Configure main filters

First, determine which templates types are going to be displayed in the right hand menu in the library:

Step 1: Go to **Settings**, and click on **Filters**.

Step 2: For each template you want the users to be able to filter, drag and drop that item from the **Document and Entity types** to the Filters area.

Step 3: You can click on the **Create group** option to further organise filters by creating groups under one label.

Step 4: Once you finish, click on **Save**.

Now, the users of your collection will be able to use the filters that you have defined.

## Configure a second tier of filters on the sidebar

Besides having the templates as filters, you can also add which metadata properties you would like to have shown on the right hand menu, for more specific filter options. These filters come from the properties assigned to each entity on a corresponding template.

Step 1: Go to **Settings**, click on **Templates**.

Step 2: Click on the field (e.g. Pais) that you want to include as a filter.

Step 3: Click on the **Edit** button of the property.

Step 4: Check the **Use as filter** and the **Default filter** options.

Step 5: You may optionally want to check the **Show in cards** option, as well.

Step 5: Click on **Save**. You can now go to the library section ![image alt text](images/image_42.png)and view the filters you have just configured.

These filters are presented to the users of your collection when no entity is selected. This option is best used when you want to apply relevant filters to several templates.

**Note:** You will see the And/Or toggle only on metadata that have multi-select properties.

- Using the AND operator will display the entities that contain all the properties for which you are filtering.

- Using the OR operator will display the entities that contain at least one of the properties for which you are filtering.
