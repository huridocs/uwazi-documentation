# Glossary of Terms

- **Collection** refers to the database that you are building with the Uwazi software. This can also be called your **Instance**.

- **Connection** - A word that is sometimes used to describe a **Relationship**, which is a feature that allows **Entities** to be connected to one another.

- **Cookies** are bits of information shared by the websites you visit and stored on your computerâ€™s hard drive. They help improve your web browsing experience as they "remember" your preferences from previous visits.

- **CSS** is a language that describes how HTML elements should be displayed.

- **CSV file** is a comma-separated values file that can be imported into Uwazi. It is particularly helpful when you have a large number of datapoints that need to be migrated into your **Collection**.

- **Data Model** refers to the logical structure of your **Collection** or, in other words, how the different types of **Entities** in your collection are organised and how they relate to one another.

- **Entity** - In Uwazi, an entity is a type of information in your collection (e.g. court, person, event). It has properties, can hold **Primary Documents** and/or **Supporting Files**, and can have **Relationships** to other **Entities**.

- **Fallback** is an alternative document if the main (or intended) one is not available.

- **Favicon** is an icon that appears in the browser tab and bookmarks.

- **Filters** are criteria that narrow down the types of **Entities** shown at a given moment in the Library. There are two different kinds: **Primary Filters**, which are derived from the types of entity templates that exist in your **Collection**, and **Secondary Filters**, which are derived from specific **Properties** within an entity **Template**.

- **Instance** is your specific copy of the Uwazi software. In other words, it refers to your **Collection**.

- **Landing page** is the first page that visitors see when they arrive at your **Instance**.

- **Library** ![](images/image_0.png) is the place where all of your **Entities** are displayed together for easy access.

- **Metadata** is data that provides information about other data. In Uwazi, it usually usually describes the types of **Properties** included in an **Entity**.

- **Primary Document** is the main PDF that can be displayed, read and highlighted within an **Entity** in Uwazi.

- **Property** is a descriptive attribute that is assigned to **Entities** (e.g. author, significance, status, etc).

- **Published Entities** are seen by the public (if the instance is set to public) or everyone who has access to the instance (if the instance is set to private).

- **Relationship** - In Uwazi, a **Relationship** allows entities to be connected to each other. We sometimes use the term **Connection** to describe the same feature.

- **Relationship Types** are different types of **Relationships** that you can establish between or even within **Entities**. Each has a descriptive name that captures the essence of the Relationship.

- **Reference** connects selected content in a PDF to something else. References can be made to other selected content in the same **Primary Document**, other selected content in another **Primary Document**, to an entire other **Primary Document**, or to another **Entity**.

- **Restricted Entities** exist in the **Library** but have not been **Published** yet. They are only accessible to **Admin** and **Editor** users as well as select individuals who have been granted explicit permission.

- **Supporting Files** are attachments in any format (e.g., .doc, .txt, .jpg, .mp3, etc) that are relevant to an **Entity**.

- **Template** are a starting point for new entities in Uwazi. They can be built and customised with different properties for each type of entity.

- **Thesauri / Thesaurus** - In Uwazi, **Thesauri** refer to lists of terms that are referenced in **Select** and **Multiselect** properties. Thesauri is the plural form of the word thesaurus.

- **User** is anybody who has login credentials to your **Instance**. There are different types of user roles (**Admin**, **Editor**, **Collaborator**) and access levels.

- **ZIP File** is a compressed format that you need to use with the **CSV Import** feature when adding **Entities** that contain **Primary Documents** and/or **Supporting Files**.
