# Glossary of Terms

- **Collection** refers to the database that you are building with the Uwazi software. This can also be called your **Instance**.

- **Connection** - A word that is sometimes used to describe a **Relationship**, which is a feature that allows **Entities** to be connected to one another.

- **Cookies** are bits of information shared by the websites you visit and stored on your computerâ€™s hard drive. They help improve your web browsing experience as they "remember" your preferences from previous visits.

- **CSS** is a language that describes how HTML elements should be displayed.

- **CSV file** is a comma-separated values file that can be imported into Uwazi. It is particularly helpful when you have a large number of datapoints that need to be migrated into your **Collection**.

- **Data Model** refers to the logical structure of your **Collection** or, in other words, how the different types of **Entities** in your collection are organised and how they relate to one another.

- **Entity** - In Uwazi, an entity is a type of information in your collection (e.g. court, person, event). It has properties, can hold **Primary Documents** and/or **Supporting Files**, and can have **Relationships** to other **Entities**.

- **Fallback** is an alternative document if the main (or intended) one is not available.

- **Favicon** is an icon that appears in the browser tab and bookmarks.

- **Filters** are criteria that narrow down the types of entities shown at a given moment in the Library. There are two different kinds: Primary Filters, which are derived from the types of entity templates that exist in your collection, and Secondary Filters, which are derived from specific properties within an entity template.

- **Instance** is your specific copy of the Uwazi software. In other words, it refers to your collection.

- **Landing page** is the first page that visitors see when they arrive at your Uwazi instance.

- **Library** ![](images/image_0.png) is the place where all of your entities are displayed together for easy access.

- **Metadata** is data that provides information about other data. In Uwazi, it usually usually describes the types of properties included in an entity.

- **Primary Documents** are the main PDFs that can be displayed, read and highlighted within Uwazi.

- **Property** is a descriptive attribute that is assigned to entities (e.g. author, significance, status, etc).

- **Published Entities** are seen by the public (if the instance is set to public) or everyone who has access to the instance (if the instance is set to private).

- **Relationship** - In Uwazi, a **Relationship** allows entities to be connected to each other. We sometimes use the term **Connection** to describe the same feature.

- **Relationship Types** are different types of **Relationships** that you can establish between or even within **Entities**. Each has a descriptive name that captures the essence of the Relationship.

- **Reference** connects selected content in a PDF to something else. References can be made to other selected content in the same document, other selected content in another document, an entire document, or an entity.

- **Restricted Entities** exist in the **Library** but have not been **Published** yet. They are only accessible to the administrator(s) or logged-in users.

- **Supporting Files** are attachments in any format (e.g., .doc, .txt, .jpg, .mp3, etc) that are relevant to an entity.

- **Template** are a starting point for new entities in Uwazi. They can be built and customised with different properties for each type of entity.

- **Thesauri / Thesaurus** - In Uwazi, thesauri refer to lists of terms that are referenced in select and multiselect properties of entities. Thesauri is the plural form of thesaurus.

- **User** is anybody who has login credentials to your Uwazi instance. There are different types of user roles and access levels.

- **ZIP file** is a compressed format that you need to use with the CSV import feature when adding entities in bulk that contain Primary Documents and/or Supporting Files.
