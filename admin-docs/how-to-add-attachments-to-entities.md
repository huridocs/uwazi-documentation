# How to Add Attachments to Entities

## Add attachment(s) to your entity

If you wish, you can also add a .doc, .txt, .odt, .jpg file to your entity as an attachment. This could contain additional information that you would like attached to your entity.

The difference between documents and attachments in Uwazi is that a document is a PDF that gets shown in the main section of Uwazi when an entity is viewed, whereas attachments are visible an filenames only (and are available for download), but their actual contents are not visible in Uwazi.

Step 1: Open and view the entity.

Step 2: In the sidebar, scroll down and you will see an option for **Attachments**.

Step 3: You can add a file that will be visible along with your entity.

- You can use the **Add to all languages** option if you would like your attachment to be accessible to those viewing the entity in any of the languages Uwazi supports. **Note:** This option will only be available if your instance has more than one UI language.
