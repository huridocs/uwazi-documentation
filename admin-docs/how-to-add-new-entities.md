# How to Add New Entities

> Entity:  Something that has properties, is filterable, and can have connections. Some examples of entities may include a court, a case, a specific person or event. Before you can create a new entity, make sure you have already created a corresponding template!

To create a new entity:

Step 1: Go to the the private documents section ![image alt text](images/image_29.png)on the navigation bar.

Step 2: Click on the **New entity** button.

Step 3: Select which template to use, and give the entity a title and add other metadata that you want to include. (You may always come back to add, edit or delete this information later.)

Step 4: Click the **Save** button once you are finished.

When you are ready to share your entity in the Public documents section ![image alt text](images/image_30.png), select **Publish** on the entity.

(**Note:** if your Uwazi instance is set to Private, the entities are only shared with other logged in users who have the permission to view this information.)
