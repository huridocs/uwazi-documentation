If you have encountered a problem while using Uwazi, we want to help!

The [Uwazi repository on **GitHub**](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi) is the main support channel. There, you can report the problem directly to our development team by clicking on **[Issues](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/issues)** and adding a new one. (You must create a free GitHub account to do so.)

Alternatively, if the problem is private or contains sensitive information, please email your HURIDOCS programme officer or [support@uwazi.io](mailto:support@uwazi.io).

Either way, please consider the following guidelines when submitting your report:
- Offer a precise description of the problem, including an explanation of when it first occurred, what you were doing when it occurred, and if it continues to occur.
- If you received an error message within Uwazi at any point, take note of the error code and include it in your report.
- It's helpful to include screenshots or a screen recording to further illustrate the problem.
