## Add new users to your instance ([screencast](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12Z-HtNoPU2vcS80CG30496ECAL5vEJI3))

Step 1: Only an Admin can create new users. Go to **Settings** and click on **Users**.

Step 2: You will see a list of all the current users who have access to your collection.

Step 3: You can create new users by clicking the green **Add user** button at the bottom. Here, you can also edit or delete users, as necessary.

Step 4: Enter a **username**, their **email address** and select a role (**Admin** or **Editor**) for them.

Step 5: Once this information is entered, click the green **Save** button and an email will be sent to that person with a link that allows them to set their own password.
