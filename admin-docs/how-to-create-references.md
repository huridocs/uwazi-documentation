# How to Create References

> In Uwazi, a reference is a bookmark that connects highlighted content in one document to something else -- such as other selected content in the same document, other selected content in a different document, or even an entire document or an entity.

### Reference other text in the same or a different document

Step 1: Go to **Settings** and click on **Relationship types** to add a "type of connection."

- **Note:** You must define your relationship type(s) first in order to create references.

Step 2: Click **View** on the file for which you want to create the reference. Note that references can only be made from text selected in a PDF document.

Step 3: Select the text you want. Three options will appear. Click on **Connect to a paragraph**.
